        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
            <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup capers, drained</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>3 (8 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Stir in flour and garlic; stir constantly until garlic is fragrant and flour is mixed well, about 1 minute. Pour in chicken broth and half-and-half. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, until sauce is bubbly and thick, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from heat and stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, lemon juice, capers, salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>    
            <li>Slice each chicken breast lengthwise into 2 cutlets. Place in a single layer in the prepared dish. Season with salt and pepper. Spread the sauce evenly over the chicken and top with lemon slices.</li>
            <li>Combine remaining 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese and bread crumbs. Sprinkle evenly over the casserole.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 20 to 25 minutes. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve warm.</li>    
        </ol>
