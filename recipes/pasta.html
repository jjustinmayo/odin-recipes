        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>½ (16 ounce) package gemelli pasta</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons herb-infused extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>½ medium onion, chopped</li>
            <li>pound fresh asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>            
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>cups cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>            
            <li>¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>            
            <li>tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>            
            <li>2 cups 1% milk</li>
            <li>⅔ cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
            <li>¼ cup shredded provolone cheese</li>
            <li>⅓ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 7x11-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook gemelli at a boil until flexible but still firm to the bite, about 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and stir for 2 minutes. Add asparagus and mushrooms and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms begin to soften and asparagus is bright green, about 4 minutes.</li>    
            <li>Add tomatoes, garlic, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Continue cooking for about 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Pour the vegetable mixture into a large mixing bowl. Drain pasta and stir into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in the same skillet. Add flour and cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture bubbles, about 4 minutes. Pour in milk, stirring briskly to avoid lumps. Continue to stir until sauce thickens and bubbles again, about 4 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in 1/3 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano and provolone cheese until melted.</li>
            <li>Pour the cheese sauce over the pasta and vegetables and stir to combine. Pour into the prepared baking dish. Taste and adjust seasonings. Toss remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano with bread crumbs and sprinkle over the casserole.</li>    
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
